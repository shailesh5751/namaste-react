# How to use React?

There are two primary ways to use React:

## 1. Using a CDN (Content Delivery Network)

- React libraries are hosted on CDN links.
- `cross-origin`: The requesting and responding systems can be different (browser requests files from CDN servers).
- **React (react.js):** Core React framework, contains the core algorithms and logic.
- **React-DOM (react-dom.js):** Handles DOM operations, required for updating and rendering the DOM.

ðŸ‘‰ React is split into **two different files** because React can be used on different platforms (e.g., web, mobile, VR).  
For web development specifically, we use **React-DOM**.

## 2. Using a Local Development Setup
(Coming soon: via `create-react-app`, Vite, or bundlers like Webpack.)
